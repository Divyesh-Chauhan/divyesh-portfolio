# CV / Resume

**Drop your CV here** so the portfolio can link to it automatically.

1. Place your CV file in this folder (`public/cv/`).
2. Name it **`resume.pdf`** (or update the filename in `src/App.jsx` if you use a different name).
3. The site links to whatever file is in this folder—replace the file anytime; no code changes needed.
4. Clicking "Download CV" on the site will download the file as **Divyesh_Chauhan_CV.pdf** (no preview).

Supported for linking: **resume.pdf** (recommended). Use PDF for best compatibility.
